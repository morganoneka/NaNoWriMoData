# Visualizing Nanowrimo Stats
[National Novel Writing Month](nanowrimo.org/) is a month-long challenge to write an entire novel (or, at least the first 50,000 words of a novel) in one month. Its spin off events, "Camp NaNoWriMo", occur in April and July, encouraging writers to achieve self-set goals.

This codebase provides scripts to scrape a person's NaNoWriMo stats then visualize trends for both NaNoWriMo events and Camp events.

Please note, you'll only be able to scrape data for yourself, your buddies, and non-buddies who have their project data public to everyone (which does not include many people).
